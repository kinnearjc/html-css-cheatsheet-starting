        <h1>HTML/CSS Cheatsheet</h1>
        <p id="intro_paragraph"> Coding in HTML and CSS is fun! Though it can be difficult to remember every element you've learned. In order to aid in that endeavor, creating a Cheatsheet for quick reference can really help out!</p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is the backbone of webpages. Though it is responsible for creating these pages, it is rather limited in what it can do:</p>
        <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
        <p>Lists come in two varieties: Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists. Check out the Unordered List of anchor tags below!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#text">Text(Headers/Paragraphs)</a></li>
            <li><a href="#hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a></li>
            <li><a href="#tables">Tables</a></li>
            <li><a href="#media">Media</a></li>
            <li><a href="#lists">Lists(Ordered/Unordered like this one!)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="text">Text</h3>
        <p>Basic text is a big part of HTML. You can write paragraphs that stretch a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long ways...</p>
        <p>You can also change your text to provide <em>emphasis</em> or show <strong>strong</strong> text.</p>
        <h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>Similar to the various anchors to parts of the page shown in the list section, you can also use anchor tags to write hyperlinks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus" target="_blank">this!</a></p>
        <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
        <p>HTML can also create tables. With a little help from CSS, they can help us organize and style data we wish to represent.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th colspan="7">Schedule by The Cure</th>

              </tr>
            </tfoot>
           </table>
        <h3 id="media">Media</h3>
        <p>There are various kinds of media that can be shown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pictures: <br>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is responsible for styling HTML elements. CSS can drastically improve the look of your webpage, but for example purposes, I'm going to keep this one simple.</p>
        <h3>Methods of including CSS</h3>
        <p>There are three ways to include CSS in you web design:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Writing CSS in a dedicated section of your HTML</li>
          <li>Writing CSS inline in your HTML</li>
          <li>Writing CSS in a dedicated file</li>
        </ol>
